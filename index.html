      <p>Cancel culture is the idea of taking away support for an individual, their career, popularity and/or fame because of something they’ve said or done that’s considered unacceptable, as a result receiving public backlash.</p>
      <p>Cancel Culture includes calling out celebrities/people, putting them on blast on social media, and boycotting their film/restaurant/etc. Some go as far as sending them and their families death threats and also contacting their work place to get them fired.</p>
      <p>Canceling first started as calling out celebrities/performers/etc for actual harmful acts that they’ve done and/or hateful content that these creators have made, but now, canceling has become weaponized to attack people just because of their personal disliking.
