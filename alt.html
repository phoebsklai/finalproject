    <h3>Calling In : </h3>
    <p> Calling in is the speaking to an individual privately about their perceived harmful or problematic actions or opinions. Calling out is seen by some activists as an effective way to create change and reduce harm while allowing an offending individual to learn, grow, and change.</p>
<h3> Educating over Alienation : </h3>
    <p>Educating others instead of canceling is also another way to do it : education over alienation. Telling someone, “Hey, I don’t know if you realized this, but ‘x statement’ is actually offensive, because…”  usually results in “I’m sorry, I didn’t know, thank you for telling me!” Because by saying “I can’t believe you said that you’re #canceled” often leads to the mob mentality of cancel culture leaving the subject without a means to correct themselves. People deserve a chance to learn and educate themselves to become better individuals. Automatically canceling them teaches them nothing and will often have more negative effects. </p>
