        <p>Cancel culture has been considered acceptable by some people in some cases because it seemed to provide a way for marginalized individuals and groups to silence someone they deemed hurtful. As a result, powerful individuals or groups that would otherwise evade responsibility for their destructive behaviors would be exposed to the facts and face the consequences.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, cancel culture has been called a negative, even toxic way of simplifying complex issues and encouraging snap judgments that can easily result in overly harsh consequences in less offensive situations.</p>
        <h2>HARMFUL EFFECTS OF CANCEL CULTURE </h2>
        <p>Like bullying, if you've been canceled, you may feel ostracized, socially isolated, and lonely.If you are canceled, it can also feel as if everyone is giving up on you before you've even had the chance to apologize (let alone change your behavior). Instead of creating a dialogue to help you understand how your actions hurt others, the cancelers shut off all communication, essentially robbing you of the opportunity to learn and grow from your mistakes. </p>
        <p>A review of research on media and adolescent brain development found that teens are particularly vulnerable to social influences because the regions of the brain involved in the social aspects of life are still maturing. Brain imaging studies show that social rejection literally hurts: It lights up the same parts of the adolescent brain that are activated by physical pain.</p>
        <p>As a result, being socially ostracized, at an age when peer connections are incredibly important, can be devastating. Many therapists report treating teen clients who suffered from depression and suicidality for months after being canceled by peers. Teens who experience this may struggle for years to trust themselves, to trust others, and to feel a sense of belonging in a peer group.</p>
        <h2>CANCEL CULTURE ON FAMOUS PEOPLE  VS. NONFAMOUS PEOPLE : </h2>
        <h3>Ellen Degeneres</h3>
        <p>In 2020, daytime television star Ellen Degeneres was supposedly “cancelled” after being accused of fostering a “toxic” workplace culture. The former employees claimed that DeGeneres is not the same person she appears to be on the show when the cameras stop rolling. Instead, one claimed she was “demeaning” and her senior exclusives failed to follow through with her famous tagline of “be kind”, firing people who took sick or bereavement leave. One former employee also claimed that her top senior producers made “racist comments” and contributed to micro-aggressions on set. Her programme, The Ellen Show, returned in September but executively have officially now cancelled the show.</p>
        <h3>J.K.  Rowling </h3>
        <p>Renowned author J.K Rowling was “cancelled” for a succession of controversial online posts and activities that have been labeled as transphobic by many LGBTQ+ activists and organizations. Rowling is what is known as a TERF, or trans exclusionary radical feminist. In simple terms, this is a feminist that doesn’t consider trans women to be women. </p>
        <h3>James Charles </h3>
        <p>Multiple allegations of him grooming and sending explicit photos and messages to minors and multiple victims have come forward with their experiences with him. People started boycotting his makeup palette, and as a result of all this information coming out, he was demonetized on Youtube temporarily and was later dropped by Morphe. Even after all this, he has come out unscathed, posting tiktoks and youtube videos on the regular while growing his account.</p>
        <p>Even after these famous creators careers took a hit, people often forget about it months after...so in short, famous people can't be cancelled. Their careers always bounce back months after. </p>
        <p>The reason for people to ‘cancel’ someone nowadays has been blurred. While some reasons are valid, some are a misunderstanding that has been getting way out of hand.  Some victims of cancel culture are generally not powerful people. They are often vulnerable people who suffer devastating harm.</p>
        <h3> USC Chinese Professor </h3>
        <p>A professor at the University of Southern California was placed on leave for using a Chinese word that some people think sounds like the n-word even though it is simply the Chinese word for “that.” The professor is a member of USC US-China Institute, and was teaching a communications course and was using the word to illustrate how different languages use different words to fill in pauses. Some or all of the Black students across three sections of the course were offended by what they’d heard. So they wrote a letter to the dean of the Marshall School of Business, Geoffrey Garrett, among others, describing Patton as insensitive and incapable of teaching the three-week intensive communications course. He was fired than replaced by another professor. </p>
        <h3> African American Security Guard Incident </h3>
        <p> An African American school security guard was fired for using the N-word in the course of telling a student not to direct that word at him. Thankfully, he was eventually re-hired after a national furor erupted.</p>
